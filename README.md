# Getting a Research Gig: A Guide
Advice to get an awesome undergraduate research opportunity!!! 

# Introduction
Well, hi! This is my guide to undergraduate research opportunities. Throughout my undergraduate career I have participated in four research experiences: two at my home institution, a summer fellowship program at/through Washington University in St. Louis, and one REU at the University of California at Berkeley. However, last year I had great success in my applications - I got accepted into every research program I applied, which included some competitive programs at MIT, UMass Amherst, Oregon State University, etc... 

You can do this too! You're here, which is great. Keep moving up! 

Disclaimer #1: My advice does not replace the advise of a faculty member, professor, academic advisor, fellowship advisor, all-powerful sorcerer, genie with cosmic powers, a ghost of Robin Williams, etc. Also, this is by no means a recipe for guaranteed admission - but more on that later. Mostly, this is my own reflection on what made my own applications successful this past year. 

Disclaimer #2: My advice mostly relates to opportunities in STEM fields, however you can probably easily identify and choose what is relevant to you and what is not.

### Debunking Common Myths & Fears
#### "You have to be a genius to do research."

There exists a notion that in order to meaningfully contribute to research as an undergraduate, one must be a kid-genius. This is not true. Yes - the kid-geniuses definitely exist, but I hypothesize (someone else can collect the data!) that they are in the minority. 

Remember: a professor, lab, program, or group will not take you on if they do not believe you will make a meaningful contribution to the project or that you are capable of advancing your field of study. You are there to gain experience, and in doing so, you will contribute. Sometimes, a lack of experience in an area can even translate to fresh, new perspectives on a problem. Just be your regularly scheduled you and utilize those problem solving skills and knowledge you've picked up in your coursework and other experiences, and be willing to persevere through challenging or frustrating problems. **You'll be awesome.** 

#### "I don't know anything about the topic I might do research in."

This is a similar fear as above. In the same way that you do not have to be a genius to do research, you also do not have to be an expert. Yes, prerequisite knowledge is helpful, and sometimes programs/professors/etc prefer students with coursework or prior projects in their area to join their groups. But as an undergraduate, most programs/professors/people-who-have-the-power-to-admit-you know that you likely do not have any experience in a specific area and are rather seeking to gain experience. Everyone starts somewhere, your first machine learning experience might be through research or through a course. You might have to be flexible on this first experience - but you also might not have to be!

#### Fear-Squashing Advice
Some of the best advice I've ever received is "don't even read the qualifications, just apply!" Let someone else tell you no or that you do not have enough experience to do the thing you want to do. If you want to do research, then apply to REUs, talk to professors in the area, make friends with graduate students, read related publications. Doing research is scary, but the thing is... _you can do it_. 

# Your Search
So now that you've decided you want to spend your summer doing undergraduate research, where do you start? Well, you have multiple options. They are: 

### Your Home Institution
### NSF REUs
### DAAD RISE
### Institution-Sponsored Research Programs
### Through Your Network



# A Note About Admissions
So here is the bad news: you could be the most qualified, perfect applicant to an NSF REU or other research program, and still get rejected. Why? Well, there are a lot of reasons: 

- Professor/Mentor Mismatch
- A system designed to favor false negatives.

# Your Offers
You got accepted! Hooray! What are your next steps? Here is what I suggest:

1. **Party!** You did the thing! Celebrate your achievements! 
2. **Negotiate.** So, it is most likely that you will not be able to negotiate pay or benefits for a research experience in the same way that you would an internship or job. What I _really_ mean when I say "negotiate" is _make sure this is the research experience you want_. Before accepting an offer, I recommend that you ask your program coordinator to put you in touch with your research advisor/PI (principal investigator). Then, you should ask your PI the following questions: 
  - **Who else is working on the project? Other professors, graduate student(s), undergrad(s)?** 
  - **Who will I likely be interacting with the most?**
  - **Will you (or anyone on the project) be traveling for long periods of time?** 
  - **What will my project be? Or, if the specific project is still undefined, what are some possible projects/areas/topics I could be working on?** 
  - **What skills, tools, or techniques will I be using/learing?**
  - **Are there relevant papers I can read in advance?**
  - **Can we talk on the phone or Skype about the project?**
  - **Will there be an opportunity to publish?**  
  
If any of the answers to these questions raise a red flag, trust your instinct and contact your program coordinator. The best time to switch projects or PIs is _before_ the program even starts. That way, you haven't wasted your time (or the PI's summer). It's totally reasonable to say that your research interests have changed in some way. Now, your program coordinator may or may not be able to make this change happen, but you should always (politely) ask for what you want.  
3. **Decide.** Once you have some approximate information about what your summer will look like - what your area of research will be, who you will be working with, what you will learn along the way - it is time to decide whether or not that research program is for you! Hindsight is 20/20, so here are some things I would weigh heavily in my own decision: 
  - **Is this a research area I can see myself wanting to pursue in the future?** You may or may not know the answer to this, and that's OK! But if you get accepted into a robotics program and you see yourself as being a roboticst in the future, then this might be a better choice than, say, a bioinformatics program. 
  - **Is there a potential to publish?** Whether you decide you want to pursue research beyond your undergraudate education or not, publishing is a big deal. If your advisor says there is a potential to write a paper/present at a conference, then you will gain valuable experience (and, um, prestige). 
  - **Are the skills, tools, and technologies I will be using/learning relevant/popular/in demand?** While research experience in itself is valuable, so are the tools you learn while doing research. When possible, choose experiences where the techniques you are using are cutting-edge and in demand in industry as well as academia.
  - **Do the people seem cool?** If you are able to interact at all with the people you will be working with, this is an important question to consider! _Who_ you work with almost always matters more than _what_ you are working on when it comes to having an enjoyable experience. 
  - **Does the location of the program seem fun? Safe? Affordable?** All important questions to be answered. I spent a summer in St. Louis and absolutely loved it because there were so many free things to do when I wasn't working. However, at Berkeley, I did not always feel safe in the evenings and it severely limited how much I enjoyed my summer. Remember, this is an opportunity to learn and grow as an academic, but it's your summer too! 

Now you're on your way!

# FAQ
### How many programs should I apply to? 
REU programs are competitive. I would suggest applying somewhere between 8-12 if you are serious about going to another institution to do research or if your home institution does not conduct research in your area of interest.But this is totally up to you! If you only want to do research in a specific area or in a specific location, apply to just the programs that interest you. Do what works for you. Keep in mind that your applications will likely improve as you gain experience in applying, and eventually you will hit the point of diminishing returns. Use your time wisely. 

### What if I am rejected everywhere I apply? 
If you're a planner like me, you want to account for this possibility. Here is my advice:
1. Don't panic or get discouraged. Remember that competitive programs typically yield false negatives and that a lot is dependent on timing and other variables totally out of your control. But you can still do great research this summer and learn a lot.

### What if one program accepts me and needs me to respond before another program I am more interested in notifies me?
