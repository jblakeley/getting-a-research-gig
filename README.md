# Getting a Research Gig: A Guide
Advice to get an awesome summer research opportunity. 

# Introduction
Thinking about conducting undergraduate research? Want to know if graduate school is right for you? Here's a guide to (a) understanding if research is right for you and (b) maximizing your potential summer research opportunities. My sophomore year of college I was accepted into 3 summer research programs outside of my campus and last year I was accepted into every program to which I applied, which included some top research insitutions like UC Berkeley and MIT. You can do this too! 

Disclaimer: my advice does not replace the advise of a faculty member, professor, or academic advisor. This is by no means a recipe to guaranteed admission, these are just tips I've found to be helpful and to have worked in my own experience. Also, this guide has a clear bias towards STEM fields.
