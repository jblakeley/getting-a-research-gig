# Getting a Research Gig: A Guide
Advice to get an awesome undergraduate research opportunity!!! 

# Introduction
Well, hi! This is my guide to undergraduate research opportunities. Throughout my undergraduate career I have participated in four research experiences: two at my home institution, a summer fellowship program at/through Washington University in St. Louis, and one REU at the University of California at Berkeley. However, last year I had great success in my applications - I got accepted into every research program I applied, which included some competitive programs at MIT, UMass Amherst, Oregon State University, etc... 

You can do this too! You're here, which is great. Keep moving up! 

Disclaimer #1: My advice does not replace the advise of a faculty member, professor, academic advisor, fellowship advisor, all-powerful sorcerer, genie with cosmic powers, a ghost of Robin Williams, etc. Also, this is by no means a recipe for guaranteed admission - but more on that later. Mostly, this is my own reflection on what made my own applications successful this past year. 

Disclaimer #2: My advice mostly relates to opportunities in STEM fields, however you can probably easily identify and choose what is relevant to you and what is not.

# Your Fit

### Debunking Common Myths & Fears
- "You have to be a genius to do research."
- "I don't know anything about the topic I might do research in." 

# Your Search
So now that you've decided you want to spend your summer doing undergraduate research, where do you start? Well, you have multiple options. They are: 

### Your Home Institution
### NSF REUs
### DAAD RISE
### Institution-Sponsored Research Programs
### Through Your Network



# A Note About Admissions
So here is the bad news: you could be the most qualified, perfect applicant to an NSF REU or other research program, and still get rejected. Why? Well, there are a lot of reasons: 

- Professor/Mentor Mismatch
- A system designed to favor false negatives.

# Your Offers
You got accepted! Hooray! What are your next steps? Here is what I suggest:

1. **Party!** You did the thing! Celebrate your achievements! 
2. **Negotiate.** So, it is most likely that you will not be able to negotiate pay or benefits for a research experience in the same way that you would an internship or job. What I _really_ mean when I say "negotiate" is _make sure this is the research experience you want_. Before accepting an offer, I recommend that you ask your program coordinator to put you in touch with your research advisor/PI (principal investigator). Then, you should ask your PI the following questions: 
  - **Who else is working on the project? Other professors, graduate student(s), undergrad(s)?** 
  - **Who will I likely be interacting with the most?**
  - **Will you (or anyone on the project) be traveling for long periods of time?** 
  - **What will my project be? Or, if the specific project is still undefined, what are some possible projects/areas/topics I could be working on?** 
  - **What skills, tools, or techniques will I be using/learing?**
  - **Are there relevant papers I can read in advance?**
  - **Can we talk on the phone or Skype about the project?**
  - **Will there be an opportunity to publish?**  
  
If any of the answers to these questions raise a red flag, trust your instinct and contact your program coordinator. The best time to switch projects or PIs is _before_ the program even starts. That way, you haven't wasted your time (or the PI's summer). It's totally reasonable to say that your research interests have changed in some way. Now, your program coordinator may or may not be able to make this change happen, but you should always (politely) ask for what you want.  
3. **Decide.** Once you have some approximate information about what your summer will look like - what your area of research will be, who you will be working with, what you will learn along the way - it is time to decide whether or not that research program is for you! Hindsight is 20/20, so here are some things I would weigh heavily in my own decision: 
  - **Is this a research area I can see myself wanting to pursue in the future?** You may or may not know the answer to this, and that's OK! But if you get accepted into a robotics program and you see yourself as being a roboticst in the future, then this might be a better choice than, say, a bioinformatics program. 
  - **Is there a potential to publish?** Whether you decide you want to pursue research beyond your undergraudate education or not, publishing is a big deal. If your advisor says there is a potential to write a paper/present at a conference, then you will gain valuable experience (and, um, prestige). 
  - **Are the skills, tools, and technologies I will be using/learning relevant/popular/in demand?** While research experience in itself is valuable, so are the tools you learn while doing research. When possible, choose experiences where the techniques you are using are cutting-edge and in demand in industry as well as academia.
  - **Do the people seem cool?** If you are able to interact at all with the people you will be working with, this is an important question to consider! _Who_ you work with almost always matters more than _what_ you are working on when it comes to having an enjoyable experience. 
  - **Does the location of the program seem fun? Safe? Affordable?** All important questions to be answered. I spent a summer in St. Louis and absolutely loved it because there were so many free things to do when I wasn't working. However, at Berkeley, I did not always feel safe in the evenings and it severely limited how much I enjoyed my summer. Remember, this is an opportunity to learn and grow as an academic, but it's your summer too! 

Now you're on your way!
